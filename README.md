# TXM's Personal Website
This is the repository for AvengeGG's graphic designer's portfolio website. 
## The Goal:
I'm hoping to accomplish all his needs with just this simple front end site.
*I want to create a simple left-sided navigation that will hide upon click
*I want to create a basic load animation upon entering and exiting pages
*Multiple pages:
.*Home
.*Portfolio
..*Will contain his creations
.*About
..*Will contain general information about him
.*Contact
..*Will contain methods of contact
